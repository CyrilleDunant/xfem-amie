AMIE comes with a series of unit tests to check that several 
features  are correctly implemented in the current version.

To compile the tests (from the build directory):

$> make unitTests

The tests are built in the "test" folder in the build directory. 
They can be run one by one or with the program "check_test" (from
the build directory): 

$> ./check_test

This program will run all tests in the test database and compare
the results with results obtained with an earlier version of AMIE.
Success is indicated in green and failure in red. Skipped tests are
in blue (tests will get skipped if they account for features that
are not ready yet).

The comparison has a certain tolerance to account for the machine
precision. Tolerance is set relative to the base value and is set
by default to 0.01. Use the following option to modify the 
tolerance (for example to 0.001):

$> ./check_test --tolerance 0.001

The comparison also ignores numbers that are too close to 0. The 
default threshold is 1e-6 but can be overriden with the following
option (for example to 1e-8):

$> ./check_test --threshold 1e-8

Each test is killed after 10 seconds. The duration can be modified
using the following option (for example 5 seconds). Choosing "0" 
will let each test run without time limit.

$> ./check_test --timeout 5

It is possible to run only a subset of the tests which name matches 
a certain string pattern. By default, all tests are run. If the 
following option is used, only the tests containing "pattern" in 
their name will be run.

$> ./check_test --match pattern

The tests can be ran with different OpenMP options, by setting the 
number of threads used in each test (8 in the following example), 
or disabling OpenMP alltogether. Note that the tests will always be 
run in a sequential order, even if OpenMP is set with a high number 
of threads.

$> ./check_test --set-num-threads 8
$> ./check_test --no-openmp

For further options, see the help:

$> ./check_test --help




==== FOR DEVELOPERS ONLY ====

An example of test.cpp can be found in "examples/data/templates". The
template file contains the necessary information to add a new test in
the database.

When a feature get corrected, it might be useful to re-compute the 
results which are used as a comparison for the tests. This can be 
achieved using the --renew-base command line option. Please only do so
when you are sure the new results are accurate.

$> test/mytest --renew-base

This can be done as a batch using check_test, including with a restriction
to certain tests:

$> ./check_test --renew-base
$> ./check_test --renew-base --match pattern

If you create a test for a feature which is not ready for deployment, 
you can force the test to be skipped by running with the following 
option. Doing so will disabling the test for all users, so please use
this option with care!

$> ./check_test --disable test
